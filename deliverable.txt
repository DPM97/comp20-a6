1. Identify three differences and three similarities between C++ and Javascript
Differences:
  - javascript isnt strictly typed
  - javascript is ALOT slower
  - javascript is a "scripting" language - thus interpreted on the fly, not 
    compiled
Similarities:
  - functions can be defined in a similar syntax to that of c++... The overall
    syntax is loosely related (atleast closer than something like python).
  - vars still need to have some sort of type whether it be var, const, or let..
  - they can both be used as backend languages. JS in the flavor of Node, and
    c++ out of the box.

2. What is your opinion of Javascript as a programming language?
  - Honestly it is my favorite language apart from the absense of types. However,
    Typescript is a fantastic framework for writingly strictly-typed javascript
    so I usually just use that. The TS enviroment is kind of a pain to set up 
    for small projects/scripts, though.
